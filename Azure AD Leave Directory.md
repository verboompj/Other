# Leave a Azure Active Directory / Tenant your Azure AD Account was added to as a Guest account

Sometimes it makes sense to be added as a guest to an external Azure Aztive Directory. In this way, you can use your own Azure AD Account to get access to external resources, without the need for the other party to setup and maintain an account for you.

After completion of your job, most of the times I noticed that , although my permissions were removed, my account would still be registered as a guest account in the other parties Azure Active Directory.

I found out I can remove myself using the Azure AD Account Portal https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r/#/profile
